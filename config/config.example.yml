# Species configuration
# Each species requires:
#   - id: NCBI taxonomy ID (e.g., "9606" for human)
#   - name: Short name used in output file naming
#   - gene_symbols_file: Path to file with gene symbols (one per line)
#   - gene_ensembl_file: Path to file with Ensembl gene IDs (one per line)
#
# Common species IDs:
#   9606  = Homo sapiens (human)
#   10090 = Mus musculus (mouse)
#   10116 = Rattus norvegicus (rat)
#   7955  = Danio rerio (zebrafish)
#   7227  = Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly)
#   6239  = Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode)
